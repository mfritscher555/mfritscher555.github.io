# Curbing Inflation

In times of high inflation, many people may ask the question: what does the central bank do to fight inflation? The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) responds to high inflation by raising the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate, essentially is the interest rate at which banks borrow money from each other. The federal funds rate, therefore, has an effect on all other interest rates in the economy; so if the federal funds rate increases, as do other interest rates. Higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money and deincintivizes people from making large purchases. More spending in the economy (and the printing of money) ultimately determines inflation. 

Let's investigate how the federal funds rate has affected inflation in the past.
