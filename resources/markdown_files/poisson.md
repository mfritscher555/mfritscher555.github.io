# Poisson Regression

In statistics classes in college, most of the curiculum revolves around the normal distribution - the bell curve. However, the applications for the normal distribution have its limits. I read the book *The Black Swan* a few years back, and it has always bothered me how most professors neglect to state the limitations of the normal curve. As the *The Black Swan* states, there are many applications where the bell curve is useless. Enter graduate school. Many other methods are mentioned and discussed, but again the normal distribution dominated 90% of the coursework.
