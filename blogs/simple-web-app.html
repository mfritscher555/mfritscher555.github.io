<h1 id="developing-a-simple-web-application-in-python">Developing a Simple Web Application in Python</h1>
<p class="date-posted">9 December 2022</p>
<p>The other day, I began learning the Flask framework in Python, which is used to develop web applications. This allowed me to practice using html and css, use Python in a way that I hadn&#39;t used it before, and learn the basics of software development. By no means do I think that I aspire to be a software developer, but it is a topic that has interested me for the past few months, and I decided to give it a crack.</p>
<p>The inspiration for the application sprouted from when I was trying to learn more about Object-Oriented programming. I began learning about classes in Python and how they can be used. In a practice file, I created different classes of shapes -- I gave each shapes unique attributes. For example, I created simple formulas that would calculate a circle&#39;s area and circumference, given its radius.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-py"><span class="hljs-class">
<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> Circle:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="other-keyword">__init__</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>, radius)</span></span>:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.radius = radius

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-function">area</span>(<span class="param">radius</span>):
        value = pi * <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.radius ** <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> value

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-function">circumference</span>(<span class="param">radius</span>):
        value = <span class="hljs-number">2</span> * pi * <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.radius
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> value
</code></pre>
<p>I then created a web application that would accept a radius as an input, and would output the area and circumference as outputs. Though these calculations are simple, the focus on the project was learning <i id="italicize-normal">how</i> to implement this function in a way that is user-friendly. </p>
<p>I then had to refactor my code such that the functions could be called within the Flask framework. 
The code can be found on my GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/mfritscher555/webapp" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<p>Learning the syntax relevant to Flask was somewhat difficult, given that it is a brand-new package to me. It was an extremely rewarding feeling to finally enter an input into the box and generate an output.</p>
