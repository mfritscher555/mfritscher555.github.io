      <h1>CaPitaLizatIon is IMPORTANT - Looping in Python</h1>
      <p class="date-posted">21 October 2022</p>
      <p>
        Today, I was attempting to iterate through a list and a dictionary and
        identify where elements in the list matched. From there, the goal was to
        create a new list, using the values from the dictionary to get a list of
        appropriate matching codes. Here is an example of what I was attempting
        to do:
      </p>
      <pre><code> 
sampleList = [<span class="hljs-string">'Apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Banana'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Orange'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Nectarine'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Pear'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Apricot'</span>]
sampleDict = {<span class="hljs-string">'apple'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1000</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'banana'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1100</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'pear'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1200</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'nectarine'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1500</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'apricot'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">9999</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'strawberry'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1600</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1700</span>}
  
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> sampleList:
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> sampleDict:
    <span class="hljs-built-in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'True'</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built-in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'False'</span>)</code></pre>
      <p>
        This is a simplified version of what I needed to do; however, this
        snippet of code demonstrates the idea. If I were to run the code above,
        I would get "False" for each element as an output. This is because
        capitalization matters in Python, i.e., if the two words that are being
        compared have differences in capitalization, then they will not be
        evaluated to being equal. Though this is a simple concept, for long
        lists, it may not be apparent that there are inconsistencies in casing,
        until there are problems down the road in your project. To fix this, I
        simply needed to make both the list and dictionary be in the same case.
        This is where list comprehension came in handy! I ensured that every
        element in the list was the same as the cases of each key in the
        dictionary. I added in this line of code to accomplish this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>sampleList = [x.casefold() <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> sampleList]</code></pre>
      <p>
        I could have used any number of case functions; however, I felt it was
        best to use casefold() and have Python ignore casing for the list
        entirely. I used a similar list comprehension to accomplish the task for
        the dictionary. Ultimately, I wanted to return a new list that contained
        a list of the codes from the original list above. In this case, I want
        the output to look like:
      </p>
      <pre><code> <span class="output-code"> >>> [1000, 1100, 1700, 1500, 1200, 9999]</span></code></pre>
      <p>
        Notice that this new list contains the codes for each fruit in the
        original list, which were obtained from the dictionary dict. To
        accomplish this, I wrote a for loop similar to the one below. It is not
        optimized, but does ultimately accomplish the goal to return the
        appropriate output. The logic initializes an empty list, where the final
        output will be stored. Then a for loop is used to iterate through each
        element of the list and check if that value is a value in the
        dictionary. If there is a match between a value in the list and the
        dictionary, then that value is appended to new_list. This is the code
        that generates the desired output:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
new_list = []
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> sampleList:
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> sampleDict:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> key, value in sampleDict.items():
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> i == key:
              new_list.append(value)</code></pre>
      <p>
        The desired output could not be obtained if there were discrepancies
        with the casing. Differences in the casing would cause the
        <code>if i in dict</code> clause to evaluate to FALSE for any element
        that does not match the casing exactly with the dictionary.
      </p>
