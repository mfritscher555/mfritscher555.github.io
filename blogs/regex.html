    Data Matching Project - Learning Regex along the Way
  </h1>
  <h2 id="the-matching-process">The matching process</h2>
  <p>
    As a part of data matching project, I wanted to be able to display
    people&#39;s names as accurately as possible. The matching process I used
    entailed matching a customer ID from one source to another. The interested
    party wanted to know which customers that the application was unable to match;
    i.e., any customers that were in one data source but not the other. The final
    deliverable was to be a list of customer names and customer IDs that were
    unmatched, so that the interested party could review these transactions.
    Though customer IDs are usually sufficient to identify these transactions, in
    the process, it is much more helpful if other information such as name and
    date are available and accurate.
  </p>
  <h2 id="using-regex">Using Regex</h2>
  <p>
    Once the matching process was established, regex was used as a way to fix some
    mistakes in people&#39;s names. For instance, suffixes for some reason got
    attached to the back of people&#39;s last names in the dataset. For example, a
    person&#39;s name might display &quot;FRITSCHERJR, MATTHEW&quot; instead of
    &quot;FRITSCHER JR, MATTHEW&quot; (by the way, I am not a Junior). Using a
    regular expression allowed me to make such changes. The following expression
    identifies any names that follow this convention:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-py">pattern = re.compile(<span class="hljs-string">r".+\S[jJ][rR],.+"</span>)
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Since there were other errors in people&#39;s names that were yet to be
    addressed (for example, the occasional symbol instead of a letter), the first
    part of the expression includes any character (the period denotes this). The
    &quot;+&quot; indicates that it will match anything up until the character
    after, which in this case is a non-space character followed by a j or J (and
    subsequently either an r or R, followed by a ,). The comma is a key part here;
    the comma allows us to differentiate a suffix versus the instances of
    &quot;jr&quot; appearing in someone&#39;s name. The &quot;.+&quot; denotes
    that any amount of characters can follow the comma.
  </p>
  <p>
    From here, a function was used to replace any instances of people&#39;s name
    that follow this pattern and fix the name so that a space separates the last
    name and the suffix. A function similar to one below was written and then
    called when writing to the final Excel file for the client.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-py">    <span class="hljs-function">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">suffix_fixer</span>(names)</span>:</span>
    master_list = []
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> name <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> names:
        pattern = re.compile(<span class="hljs-string">r".+\S[jJ][rR],.+"</span>)
        matches = pattern.findall(i)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> matches:
            i = [sub.replace(<span class="hljs-string">"JR"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">" JR"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> sub <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> _matches]
            i = i[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
            master_list.append(i)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
            master_list.append(i)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> master_list
</code></pre>
  <p>
    Being new to regex, there is a lot more to learn; however, I already see that
    there a lot of applications for using regular expressions.
